#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Please list up and carefully describe questions and suggestions for
the authors, which should focus on key points (ideally around 3–5)
that are actionable with clear guidance. Think of the things where a
response from the author can change your opinion, clarify a confusion
or address a limitation. You are strongly encouraged to state the
clear criteria under which your evaluation score could increase or
decrease. This can be very important for a productive rebuttal and
discussion phase with the authors.

Have the authors adequately addressed the limitations and potential
negative societal impact of their work? If so, simply leave “yes”; if
not, please include constructive suggestions for improvement. In

front about the limitations of their work and any potential negative
societal impact. You are encouraged to think through whether any
critical points are missing and provide these as feedback for the
authors.

- [ ] 6: *Strong Accept*: Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking
  impact on one or more areas of AI, with exceptionally strong
  evaluation, reproducibility, and resources, and no unaddressed
  ethical considerations.
- [ ] 5: *Accept*: Technically solid paper, with high impact on at least
  one sub-area of AI or moderate-to-high impact on more than one area
  of AI, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources,
  reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.

  reject, e.g., limited evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept,
  e.g. good evaluation. Please use sparingly.

  evaluation, inadequate reproducibility and incompletely addressed
  ethical considerations.
