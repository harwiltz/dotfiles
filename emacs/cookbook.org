- [ ] 5 Roma tomatoes
- [ ] 1 large zucchini (about 12 ounces)
- [ ] 1 large summer squash (about 12 ounces)
- [ ] 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for serving
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- [ ] 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste

- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- [ ] 1 pound 90% lean ground beef
- [ ] Fresh basil leaves
- [ ] Crusty bread, for serving
** Directions
1. Prep and salt the vegetables: Chop the eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, and summer squash into bite-sized pieces and add them to a large bowl. Sprinkle the salt over the vegetables and toss to combine. Let sit for 15 minutes.
2. Cook the aromatics: While the vegetables sit, heat the olive oil and garlic in a large, high-sided skillet, Dutch oven, or braising pan over medium heat. When the garlic begins to bubble around the edges, add the onion and sauté until the onion is softened and begins to brown just a bit, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, Herbes de Provence, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add the beef: Add the ground beef to the skillet. Sauté, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon or spatula while it cooks, until the beef is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
4. Cook the vegetables: Add the salted vegetables to the skillet along with any liquid that has accumulated in the bowl. Stir to combine, using the wooden spoon to nudge up any cooked-on bits from the bottom of the pan. Cover the pan and let cook, uncovering to stir every 5 minutes or so, until the vegetables are softened and cooked through but not mushy, 12 to 15 minutes.
5. Finish and serve: Uncover the pot, give everything a final stir, then turn off the heat. Tear up the basil leaves and sprinkle them over the top of the ratatouille. Add a few grinds of black pepper and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Spoon the ratatouille onto serving plates or into bowls and serve right away, with crusty bread on the side. Let any leftovers cool to room temperature, then store in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Reheat a serving in the microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring halfway through.
